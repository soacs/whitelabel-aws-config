Companies that have committed to FLA's Code of Conduct and established systems to identify and remedy ethical violations are making significant strides towards that goal. These companies are working with FLA to develop and improve social compliance systems that flag issues and lead to sustainable solutions when workers are at risk. Companies join the FLA on a voluntary basis, but they must meet strict labor standards for as long as they are affiliated. FLA holds Participating Companies accountable for monitoring 100% of their own supply chains to ensure that they meet FLA labor standards."
